== Concept

This lesson describes what is Serialization and how it can be manipulated to perform tasks that were not the original intent of the developer.

== Goals
* The user should have a basic understanding of Java programming language
* The user will be able to detect insecure deserialization vulnerabilities
* The user will be able to exploit insecure deserialization vulnerabilities
* Exploiting deserialization is slightly different in other programming languages such as PHP or Python, but the key concepts learnt here also applies to all of them
