insecure-deserialization.title=Insecure Deserialization

insecure-deserialization.invalidversion=The serialization id does not match. Probably the version has been updated. Let's try again.
insecure-deserialization.expired=The task is not executable between now and the next ten minutes, so the action will be ignored. Maybe you copied an old solution? Let's try again.
insecure-deserialization.wrongobject=That is not the VulnerableTaskHolder object. Good try! because the code is not checking this after running the readObject(). Let's try again with the right object.
insecure-deserialization.stringobject=That is not the VulnerableTaskHolder object. However a plain String is harmless. Let's try again with the right object.


insecure-deserialization.hints.1=WebGoat probably contains the org.dummy.insecure.framework.VulnerableTaskHolder class as shown on the lesson pages. Use this to construct and serialize your attack.
insecure-deserialization.hints.2=The VulnerableTaskHolder might have been updated on the server with a next version number.
insecure-deserialization.hints.3=Not all actions are allowed anymore. The readObject has been changed. For serializing it does not effect the data. Follow the additional hints from the feedback on your attempts.
