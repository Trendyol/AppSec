==== Edit Another Profile

Older apps may follow different patterns, but RESTful apps (which is what's going on here) often just change methods (and include a body or not)
to perform different functions.

Use that knowledge to take the same base request, change its method, path and body (payload) to modify another user's (Buffalo Bill's) profile.
Change the role to something lower (since higher privilege roles and users are usually lower numbers). Also change the
user's color to 'red'.
