==== Edit Your Own Profile

If an application only exposes a way to view your profile or some object (i.e. 'GET' in RESTful), that does not mean you cannot edit it.
Use your intercept proxy to modify the request such that it would modify your profile. Change the color from 'yellow' to 'black' (sans single quotes).
