=== Guessing & Predicting Patterns

==== View Your Own Profile Another Way

The application we are working with seems to follow a RESTful pattern so far as the profile goes. Many apps have roles in which an elevated user may access content of another.
In that case, just /profile won't work since the own user's session/authentication data won't tell us whose profile they want view.
So, what do you think is a likely pattern to view your own profile explicitly using a direct object reference?
