idor.hints.idorDiffAttributes2=View the response using developer tools or a proxy.
idor.hints.idorDiffAttributes3=The attributes are not visible and have nothing to do with size, color or name

idor.hints.ownProfileAltUrl1=Look at the previous request for profile, this is similar
idor.hints.ownProfileAltUrl2=You will need data from the previous request for your own profile
idor.hints.ownProfileAltUrl3=Append your id to the previous request (i.e. .../profile/{yourId})

idor.hints.otherProfile1=The default request here won't work at all, so you will need to manually craft the request or tamper it with a proxy
idor.hints.otherProfile2=You will likely need to 'fuzz' to try different values for the userId at the end of the Url
idor.hints.otherProfile3=Try incrementing the id value. It's not a simple +1, but it's also not too far off
idor.hints.otherProfile4=For editing the other user's profile, you will need to use the proxy or manually craft the request again
idor.hints.otherProfile5=To edit the other user's profile, you will use the same Url you did to view the other user's profile
idor.hints.otherProfile6=To edit, You will need to change the method, what is the RESTful method  used for 'update' or 'edit'?
idor.hints.otherProfile7=You will also need the body of the request (will look something like the profile)
idor.hints.otherProfile8=The request should go to ... /WebGoat/IDOR/profile/{Buffalo Bills Id}
idor.hints.otherProfile9=Your payload should look something like ... {\"role\" : 1,\"color\" : \"red\",\"size\" : \"small\",\"name\" : \"Tom Cat\",\"userId\" : \"2342388\"}
