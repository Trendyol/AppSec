== Introducing WebWolf

You only need WebWolf if a lesson specifies that you can use it. For many lessons, you use WebGoat without
using WebWolf. Lessons where you can use WebWolf, are marked with the following icon (top right in the assignment):

Even if the icon is present, you are not obliged to use WebWolf. You can also use any intercepting tool you like.
(`netcat` etc.)

You can always open WebWolf by clicking the icon in the top right corner.

WebWolf opens in a new browser tab and is a separate web application that simulates an attacker's machine. It makes it possible for us to
distinguish between what takes place on the attacked website and what actions you need to take as
an "attacker." The idea for WebWolf came about after a couple of workshops where we received feedback that there
was no clear distinction between what was part of the "attackers" role and what was part of the "users" role on the
website. WebWolf supports the following functionality:

* Hosting a file
* Receiving email
* Landing page for incoming requests
