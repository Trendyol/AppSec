== Landing page

This page will show all the requests made to '/landing/**'. This means
you can use WebWolf as your landing page for harvesting cookies etc. which
is helpful when you perform an XSS lesson.

Suppose we tricked a user into clicking on a link received in an email. This link will open up our crafted
password reset link page. The user notices no differences from the company's standard password reset page.
The user enters a new password and hits enter. Your host will receive the new password. In this case, the new
password ends up in WebWolf. Try to locate the unique code.

Please be aware that the user will receive an error page after resetting the password. In an actual attack scenario, the user would probably see a standard success page (this is due to a limit on what we can control with WebWolf)
