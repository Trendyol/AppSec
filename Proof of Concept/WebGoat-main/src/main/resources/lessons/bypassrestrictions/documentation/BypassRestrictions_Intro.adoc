== Concept

Users have a great degree of control over the web application's front-end.
They can alter HTML code, sometimes also scripts. Applications that require a certain input format should also validate on the server-side.

== Goals

* The user should have a basic knowledge of HTML
* The user should be able to tamper with a request before sending (with proxy or other tools)
* The user will be able to tamper with field restrictions and bypass client-side validation
