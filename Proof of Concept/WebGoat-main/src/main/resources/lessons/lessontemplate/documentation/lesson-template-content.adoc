== Step 1: writing content

Each lesson can consist of multiple pages with content (text) to explain the vulnerability at hand. The content
is written in AsciiDoc[https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/] which makes it very easy to write content (if you know Markdown, you know AsciiDoc).

You can find excellent tutorials online for the AsciiDoc syntax. We are just showing a basic overview below.
Below we will describe some constructs often used within WebGoat.

=== Sub-heading

Check AsciiDoc for syntax, but more = means smaller headings. You can *bold* text and other things.

=== Structuring files

You should set up all content to these *.adoc files. The AsciiDoc files reside in the
directory `/src/main/resources/{lesson}/documentation/`.

=== Images

Images can be referenced below, including setting style (recommended to use lesson-image as the style). The root is `/src/main/resources/{lesson}/images`

=== Code block

Write code blocks as follows:

```
[source]
----
public class A {

  private String test;
}
----
```
