This lesson describes the steps needed to add a new lesson to WebGoat. In general, there are four steps:

- Write the content. In WebGoat, we use AsciiDoc as a format.
- Create a lesson class
- Write HTML glue page, so WebGoat knows how to display the content
- Add one or more assignments within the lesson

Let's see how to create a new lesson.
