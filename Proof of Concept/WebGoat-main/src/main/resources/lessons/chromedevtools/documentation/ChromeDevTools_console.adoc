== The Console tab

In the console tab, you can see anything that a loaded JavaScript file may have printed out.
Do not worry if you see something in red. While that is an error, it has probably resolved itself.
Through the console tab, it is also possible for you to run your line of JavaScript code.

Start by clearing the console using the shortcut `CTRL+L.`

To run your JavaScript, click inside of the console and write something like:
`console.log("Hello WebGoat!");` Hit enter. `Hello WebGoat` should now appear in your console.
The console also allows you to do some basic arithmetic. If you type, for example, `1+3` and hit
enter, the console should display 4.

Note: You may see an `undefined` in the console. You can safely  ignore this statement,
it only means that the JavaScript function you have called did not return anything, therefore `undefined.`
