== Try It! Using the console

Let us try it. Use the console in the dev tools and call the javascript function *webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()*. +
You should get a response in the console. Your result should look something like this:
`phone home said
{"lessonCompleted:true, ... ,"output":"phone home response is..."`
Paste the random number, after that, in the text field below.
(Make sure you got the most recent number since it is randomly generated each time you call the function)
