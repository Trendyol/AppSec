== Concept
Logging is very important for modern systems. We use it for various reasons:

- Application monitoring and debugging.
- Audit logging: E.g. record specific actions of your users and systems.
- Security Event Monitoring: e.g. provide information to a SIEM or SOAR system that will trigger based on the information provided in these logs.

== Goals
* The user should have a basic understanding of logging and where to log for.
* The user understands the risks of log spoofing and leaking log information.
* The user will be able to do a simple log spoofing attack.
* The user will be able to tell the basic risks involved in logging.
