== Consequences of SQL injection

=== A successful SQL injection exploit can:
* Read and modify sensitive data from the database
* Execute administrative operations on the database
** Shutdown auditing or the DBMS
** Truncate tables and logs
** Add users
* Recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system
* Issue commands to the operating system

=== SQL injection attacks allow attackers to
* Spoof identity
* Tamper with existing data
* Cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances
* Allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system
* Destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable
* Become administrator of the database server
