== Examples

SQL injection can be used for far more than reading the data of a single of user. The following are just a few examples of data a hacker could input to a form field (or anywhere user input is accepted) in an attempt to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability:

* `+Smith' OR '1' = '1+` +
results in `+SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Smith' OR TRUE;+` which will return all entries from the users table
* `+Smith' OR 1 = 1; --+` +
results in `+SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Smith' OR TRUE;--';+` which, like the first example, will also return all entries from the users table
* `+Smith'; DROP TABLE users; TRUNCATE audit_log; --+` +
chains multiple SQL-Commands in order to both DROP the users table and delete all entries from the audit_log table
