== Try It! Pulling data from other tables

The input field below is used to get data from a user by their last name. +
The table is called 'user_data':

-------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE user_data (userid int not null,
                        first_name varchar(20),
                        last_name varchar(20),
                        cc_number varchar(30),
                        cc_type varchar(10),
                        cookie varchar(20),
                        login_count int);
-------------------------------------------------------

Through experimentation you found that this field is susceptible to SQL injection.
Now you want to use that knowledge to get the contents of another table. +
The table you want to pull data from is:

-------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE user_system_data (userid int not null primary key,
			                   user_name varchar(12),
			                   password varchar(10),
			                   cookie varchar(30));
-------------------------------------------------------

*6.a)* Retrieve all data from the table +
*6.b)* When you have figured it out.... What is Dave's password?

Note: There are multiple ways to solve this Assignment. One is by using a UNION, the other by appending
a new SQL statement. Maybe you can find both of them.
