== Try It!   Numeric SQL injection

The query in the code builds a dynamic query as seen in the previous example.  The query in the code builds a dynamic query by concatenating a number making it susceptible to Numeric SQL injection:

--------------------------------------------------
"SELECT * FROM user_data WHERE login_count = " + Login_Count + " AND userid = "  + User_ID;
--------------------------------------------------

Using the two Input Fields below, try to retrieve all the data from the users table.

Warning: Only one of these fields is susceptible to SQL Injection. You need to find out which, to successfully retrieve all the data.
