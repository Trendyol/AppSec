        "1": "By changing the names and emails of one or more users stored in a database.",
        "2": "By listening to incoming and outgoing network traffic.",
        "3": "By bypassing the access control mechanisms used to manage database access.",

      "text": "How could an intruder harm the security goal of availability?",
      "solutions": {
        "1": "By exploiting a software bug that allows the attacker to bypass the normal authentication mechanisms for a database.",
        "2": "By redirecting sensitive emails to other individuals.",
        "3": "Availability can only be harmed by unplugging the power supply of the storage devices.",
        "4": "By launching a denial of service attack on the servers."

    {
      "text": "What happens if at least one of the CIA security goals is harmed?",
      "solutions": {
        "1": "All three goals must be harmed for the system's security to be compromised; harming just one goal has no effect on the system's security.",
        "2": "The system's security is compromised even if only one goal is harmed.",
        "3": "It is acceptable if an attacker reads or changes data since at least some of the data is still available. The system's security is compromised only if its availability is harmed.",
        "4": "It is acceptable if an attacker changes data or makes it unavailable, but reading sensitive data is not tolerable. The system's security is compromised only if its confidentiality is harmed."
