== Confidentiality

Confidentiality is "the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes." In other words, confidentiality requires that unauthorized users should not be able to access sensitive resources. Confidentiality must be balanced with availability; authorized persons must still access the resources they have been granted permissions for.

Although confidentiality is similar to "privacy," these two words are not interchangeable. Instead, confidentiality is a component of privacy; confidentiality is implemented to protect resources from unauthorized entities.

** minimizing the number of places/times the information appears
** physical security controls such as properly secured server rooms
