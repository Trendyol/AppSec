== Claim misuse

Header claims misuse can occur when the header information is tampered with or manipulated inappropriately

=== JSON Web Key URL (JKU)

JKU is a part of the JWT specification that allows the JWT consumer to obtain the public key needed to verify the token's signature dynamically.
It is a URL that points to a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, which contains the public keys used by the issuer to sign the JWTs.

An example JKU would look like this:

[source]
----
{
"jku": "https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
}
----

=== Vulnerability

JWT claim misuse with JKU The vulnerability arises when a JWT is signed with a weak or predictable key and the server provides a JKU that points to an external location hosting the public key.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a JWT with malicious claims and using the `jku` to trick the server into verifying the JWT using a weak or manipulated key.
It all depends on the library being used inside the application.
Some libraries block downloading from a random server by default and use a list of allowed URLs.
However, filtering on URLs is quite challenging to implement, and this can be bypassed as well.

==== Exploitation Steps:

- **Identify the JKU Endpoint**: The attacker first needs to find the JKU endpoint in the application's JWT handling logic or in any exposed configurations.

- **Generate a malicious JWT**: craft a JWT with malicious claims, altering or adding claims to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

- **Sign the JWT**: Using your own private key sign the malicious JWT.

- **Send the JWT to the server**: Send the crafted JWT with the malicious claims to the server.

- **Server verification**: The server, upon receiving the JWT, validates the signature using the public key obtained from the JWKS endpoint.

- **Successful attack**: If the server uses the weak or manipulated key to verify the JWT, the attacker gains unauthorized access or executes their intended exploit.

=== Mitigation

To prevent JWT claim misuse with JKU, developers and security professionals should follow these best practices:

- **Whitelist**: utilize a whitelist to verify whether the received JKU from the token is present in the allowed list.
Be careful when comparing urls by using String comparison functions, use a whitelist instead and validate the entire url from the `jku`.

- **Static keys**: Avoid using JKU with public keys hosted on external endpoints.
Instead, use static keys that are securely managed and updated regularly.

- **Signature verification**: Ensure that the server verifies the JWT signature correctly and rejects tokens with invalid or manipulated signatures.

- **JWT validation**: Carefully validate and sanitize all JWT claims to prevent injection attacks and unauthorized access.

- **Audit and monitoring**: Regularly audit JWT usage, monitor for suspicious activity, and implement anomaly detection mechanisms.

- **Security testing**: Regularly perform security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
