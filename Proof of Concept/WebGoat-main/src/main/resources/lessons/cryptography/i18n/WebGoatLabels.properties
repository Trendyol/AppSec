6.crypto.title=Crypto Basics

crypto-encoding.empty=Try again, did you decode it properly?
crypto-encoding.success=Congratulations. That was easy, right?

crypto-hashing.empty=Try again.
crypto-hashing.oneok=Try again. You got 1 right.
crypto-hashing.success=Congratulations. You found it!

crypto-hashing.hints.1=Guess the type of hashing from the length of the hash.
crypto-hashing.hints.2=Find a online hash database or just google on the hash itself.

crypto-signing.hints.1=Use openssl to get the public key from the private key. Apparently both private and public key information are stored.
crypto-signing.hints.2=Use the private key to sign the "modulus" value of the public key.
crypto-signing.hints.3=Actually the "modulus" of the public key is the same as the private key. You could use openssl rsa -in test.key -pubout > test.pub and then openssl rsa -in test.pub -pubin -modulus -noout or other components.
crypto-signing.hints.4=Make sure that you do not take hidden characters into account. You might want to use echo -n "00AE89..." | openssl dgst -sign somekey -sha256 ... and do not forget to base64 encode the outcome


crypto-signing.notok=The signature does not match the data (modulus)
crypto-signing.modulusnotok=The modulus is not correct
crypto-signing.success=Congratulations. You found it!

crypto-encoding-xor.empty=Try again. This is not right
crypto-encoding-xor.success=Congratulations.
crypto-encoding-xor.hints.1=Did you look for online decoders for WebSphere encoded password?

crypto-secure-defaults.hints.1=After starting the docker container enter the container using docker exec -ti _dockerid_ /bin/bash
crypto-secure-defaults.hints.2=Try to gain access to /root. Try to become user root by su -
crypto-secure-defaults.hints.3=Try to change the /etc/shadow file using docker cp
crypto-secure-defaults.success=Congratulations, you did it!
crypto-secure-defaults.messagenotok=The unencrypted message is not correct, try again. The filename of the password file is correct.
crypto-secure-defaults.notok=Try again or read some of the hints.
