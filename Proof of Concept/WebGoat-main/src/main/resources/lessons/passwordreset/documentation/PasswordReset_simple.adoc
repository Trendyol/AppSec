== Email functionality with WebWolf

Let's first do a simple assignment to make sure you are able to read e-mails with WebWolf, first start WebWolf (see webWolfLink:here[])
In the reset page below send an e-mail to `username@webgoat.org` (part behind the @ is not important)
Open WebWolf and read the e-mail and login with your username and the password provided in the e-mail.
