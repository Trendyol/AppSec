==== Setting up browser

If you use the latest ZAP version (>= 2.8.0), you only need to start ZAP and click the browser button to be able to proxy, see image below:

In the browser type: http://localhost:8080/WebGoat, you should see WebGoat and the OWASP ZAP Heads On Display (if you use OWASP ZAP as the proxy):

{nbsp} +

You might notice that this is the Dutch login screen. The browser determines the language settings. For some pages, there will be some local translations. You can contribute to WebGoat and add more for your preferred language. You can disable the Heads On Display by clicking on the highlighted button. You can learn about the OWASP ZAP HUD on their website. For now, we recommend disabling it as it kind of blocks the menu items.

You should see the following in OWASP ZAP on the history panel:

On the next page, we will show how to filter these requests to see only relevant requests and configure the interceptor.
