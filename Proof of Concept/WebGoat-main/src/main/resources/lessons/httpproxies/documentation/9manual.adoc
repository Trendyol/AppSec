== Manually setting the proxy

This section is only necessary if you want to use Burp or running the browser through ZAP is not working in both
cases we need to do some extra configuration.
In the latest release of Chrome and Firefox no longer proxy traffic from localhost by default.

=== Option 1: Change settings of your browser

- To proxy localhost (and related addresses) with newer Firefox versions (>= 67), the preference network. proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost (accessible through the about:config page) must be set to true.
- To proxy localhost (and related addresses) with newer Chrome versions (>= 72) the command line argument --proxy-bypass-list=<-loopback> must be provided.

=== Option 2: Use www.webgoat.local

- Use the hostname of your machine instead of `localhost`. You can find or add a hostname in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOSX and `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` on Windows

Then in your browser, use http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat as the address.

=== Configure browser to use proxy

To manually configure a proxy in the browser, follow one of the configurations below:
