## Version 2023.3

With great pleasure, we present you with a new release of WebGoat **2023.3**. Finally, it has been a while. This year starts with a new release of WebGoat. This year we will undoubtedly release more often. From this release on, we began to use a new versioning scheme (https://calver.org/#scheme).

A big thanks to Ren√© Zubcevic and √Ängel Oll√© Bl√°zquez for keeping the project alive this last year, and hopefully, we can make
many more releases this year.

### New functionality

- New year's resolution(2022): major refactoring of WebGoat to simplify the setup and improve building times.
- Move away from multi-project setup:
  * This has a huge performance benefit when building the application. Build time locally is now `Total time:  42.469 s` (depends on your local machine of course)
  * No longer add Maven dependencies in several places
  * H2 no longer needs to run as separate process, which solves the issue of WebWolf sharing and needing to configure the correct database connection.
- More explicit paths in html files to reference `adoc` files, less magic.
- Integrate WebWolf in WebGoat, the setup was way too complicated and needed configuration which could lead to mistakes and a not working application. This also simplifies the Docker configuration as there is only 1 Docker image.
- Add WebWolf button in WebGoat
- Move all lessons into `src/main/resources`
- WebGoat selects a port dynamically when starting. It will still start of port 8080 it will try another port to ease the user experience.
- WebGoat logs URL after startup: `Please browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080/WebGoat to get started...`
- Simplify `Dockerfile` as we no longer need a script to start everything
- Maven build now start WebGoat jar with Maven plugin to make sure we run against the latest build.
- Added `Initializable` interface for a lesson, an assignment can implement this interface to set it up for a specific user and to reset the assignment back to its original state when a reset lesson occurs. See `BlindSendFileAssignment` for an example.
- Integration tests now use the same user. This saves a lot of time as before every test used a different user which triggered the Flyway migration to set up the database schema for the user. This migration took a lot of time.
- Updated introduction lesson to WebWolf.
- Added language switch for support for multiple languages.
- Removed logic to start WebGoat on a random port when port `8080` is taken. We would loop until we found a free port. We simplified this to just start on the specified port.
- Add Google formatter for all our code, a PR now checks whether the code adheres to the standard.
- Renaming of all packages and folders.
- [#1039 New OWASP Top 10](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/1093)
- [#1065 New lesson about logging](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/issues/1065)
